## Reflection

In this course, I gained a deeper understanding of the essential building blocks behind computer hardware. I learned how binary numbers and logic gates work together to process data. Through tasks involving Boolean algebra and circuit design, I realized how simple logical operations can be combined to form more advanced digital systems.

This subject strengthened my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities, especially when designing and testing logic circuits. The hands-on activities helped me clearly see how basic components connect to create functioning hardware. It gave me a solid foundation in understanding how computers operate at a hardware level.

Additionally, the lab sessions and project work made the learning experience more practical and engaging. I hope that even more lab-based activities or project assignments can be introduced in future classes, as they make it easier for me to visualize and understand complex circuit designs.
