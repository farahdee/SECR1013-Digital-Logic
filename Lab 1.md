## Introduction
This lab session focused on the basic concepts of combinational logic circuits and provided hands-on experience with real electronic components. The session emphasized practical skills such as wiring, breadboarding, and testing circuits using actual hardware. The main objective of the lab was to construct simple logic gate circuits and observe their behavior using switches and LEDs in order to verify their truth tables.
During the lab, we worked with several integrated circuit (IC) logic gates, including the 7408 (AND gate), 7404 (NOT gate), and 7432 (OR gate). These components helped us understand how different logic gates function when combined in a circuit.

## Summary
In this lab session, we successfully built and tested basic combinational logic circuits using IC logic gates. By connecting the ICs on a breadboard and using switches as inputs and LEDs as outputs, we were able to observe the behavior of AND, OR, and NOT gates. The outputs obtained matched the expected truth tables, confirming that the circuits were functioning correctly.
This practical session helped reinforce the theoretical knowledge learned in class by allowing us to directly see how logic gates work in real hardware. It also improved our understanding of how combinational logic circuits are implemented in practice.

## Reflection
Through this lab session, I gained valuable hands-on experience in working with electronic components and breadboards. At first, wiring the circuits correctly was challenging, but with careful checking and teamwork, the circuits were successfully completed. Testing the outputs using LEDs made it easier to understand how input changes affect the output of each logic gate.
