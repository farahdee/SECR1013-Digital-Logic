## Introduction
The main purpose of the 
lab was to help us understand the complete process of designing a digital circuit, starting from deriving Boolean expressions and truth tables, to simplifying equations and finally simulating the circuit. 
By using Deeds Simulator, we were able to visualize how logic circuits operate and verify their behavior through simulation.
Throughout the lab, we explored both interactive and timing simulation modes, which allowed us to observe circuit behavior in real time and 
analyze signal changes using timing diagrams. This lab helped bridge the gap between theoretical concepts learned in class and practical digital circuit design.

## Summary
In this lab, we analyzed a given combinational circuit by deriving Boolean expressions for the outputs, simplifying 
them using Boolean laws and De Morgan’s Theorem, and expressing them in SOP and POS forms. We then used Deeds Simulator to draw the circuit, generate the truth 
table, and observe the output waveforms through timing diagrams.
We followed the complete combinational circuit design process to solve a real-world problem involving an LRT coach door control system. We constructed 
truth tables, simplified Boolean expressions using Karnaugh Maps, and designed circuits using only NAND gates. The simulations confirmed that the designed circuits 
functioned correctly, as the results matched the expected truth tables and timing diagrams.

## Reflection
This lab session helped me gain a better understanding of how combinational logic circuits are designed and tested. Using Deeds Simulator made the learning 
process more interactive and easier to understand, especially when visualizing signal changes through timing diagrams. Some parts of the lab, such as simplifying 
Boolean expressions and designing circuits using only NAND gates, were challenging at first, but they became clearer after careful analysis and simulation.
